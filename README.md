# Wood
an android wood division app for a small carpentry business


### Problem: 
it is hard to efficiently divide size-varying wood resources into smaller pieces required for carpentry projects.

### Solution:
the Wood app implements an algorithm that manages to do just that!  
[(check the attached illustrated algorithm explenation)](wood-%20explanation.pdf).

#### The "long-run" toggle button:

Off- tries to find a solution that uses as little valuable wood resources as possible.  
On- tries to find a solution that will allow only efficient divisions at the cost of more valuable wood resources.
